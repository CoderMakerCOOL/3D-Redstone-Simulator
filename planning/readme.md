# Planning

This is a simple doc to help organize the project's planning by breaking the process into simpler systems.

## Todo

1. Create the Local Player class (already implemented in master)
2. Control Class to control Player's actions (like walking forward, backward, looking around, etc)
3. Control Abstraction Classes for each supported input (desktop, mobile, gamepad)
4. Implement Block placement
5. Implement Block removal
6. Reimplement collision detection (with cyclic updating nearby blocks)
