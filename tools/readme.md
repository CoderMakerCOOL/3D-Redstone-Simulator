# Tools

This folder is a repository of tools that might help with the development of this project.

# Run Scripts

Scripts that start with `run` usually just launch a local web server and open the browser with the app. `run-win` are windows scripts, `run-linux` are linux scripts. If you have node installed use node run script, if you have php installed, use php script, etc.

# Image Processing

Images, graphs and animations/videos are a must to every good repository. A gif is indeed worth a thousand words.

I go to great lengths to create great animations that capture the idea of this project to showcase it nicely, that's why I have a few image processing related scripts and tools.

I hope each can be self explanatory enough, some of them have readme's inside the folder explaining it further, you are free to explore them.
