# Tools

I do a lot of things and I like to use a lot of scripts, so this folder is a repository of useful things and scripts I use to automate or help me in the development of things related to this project.

# Running Scripts

Scripts like `run.sh` and `run-*.bat` are useful to run the application locally for development, the preferred way to serve this application locally is through node's http-serve module, which is at `run-node.bat`.

As you can imagine, I develop using Windows and rarely, Linux.

# Image Processing

I like visuals and I believe every project, repository, or system **needs** to present itself with images, diagrams or animations. They are the fastest way to convey information about what you are building.

I go to great lengths to create perfect animations that capture the idea of this project to showcase it nicely, that's why I have a few image processing related scripts and tools.

I hope each can be self explanatory enough, some of them have readme's inside the folder explaining it further, you are free to explore them.
