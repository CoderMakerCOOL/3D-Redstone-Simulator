# 3D Redstone Simulator

A javascript performance experiment to simulate minecraft's redstone logic in a 3D environment.


Main objectives and priorities for this project:

1. Menu
2. Save/Load System
3. 3D Controls similar to minecraft
4.


Dependencies, Inspiration and Credits

1. [three.js](https://threejs.org/) - Javascript 3D Library - Used to represent the world
2. [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/pt-br/) - by (Mojang)[https://mojang.com/]
3. Digital Circuit Logic, or [Boolean Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra)

Three.js will be used to show the world.



A browser app to simulate minecraft redstone logic using THREE.js
A browser app to generate multi purpose functions using interpolation.
